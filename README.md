You don't have to learn using Flowgorithm, I put it there just in case you want to run it and see the output<br>
The URL for the website where you can get the software is http://www.flowgorithm.org/<br>
You should all do the exercises in the folder named "00 basics"<br>
During the course of this week, I'll add more exercises: "01 easy" and "02 medium"<br>
There's also going to be last semester's midterm's exam, and possibly other semesters midterm exams.
